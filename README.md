# Simple Workday Scheduler

## Save Planned Events for Each Hour of the Workday

A Scheduler which includes:

- A header with the current date and time
- Timeblocks for each hour of the workday where events can be typed in
- A save button for each timeblock for saving new events or updating 
- The timeblocks are colored to show the current hour in red, past hours in gray, and future hours in green
- Some HTML and CSS were provided for this challenge. I completed the HTML and CSS and created the JS file. Some third party APIs were used including jQuery, Bootstrap, and Moment.js.
